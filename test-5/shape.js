//Question 3. What is initialisation and declaration? Check if for a given length and breadth, is the shape a square or rectangle. (eg: Let's say the length is 10 and breadth is 20, and then check).

//Initialization : The term initialization means Assigning value(data) to the variable,called "initialization".

//Declaration: The term declaration means Allocating a space to a variable in the memory,called "Declaration".

let l = 10;
let b = 20;

if(l === b) {
    console.log('shape is Sqaure');
}else {
    console.log('shape is rectangle');
}
